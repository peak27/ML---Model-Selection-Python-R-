# Model Selection (w/ Python & R)
This repository contains the 2 common Model selection method that will help you determine the right parameters required for the model and provides better prediction accuracy on the final result. K-Fold and grid search are two model selection techniques available on the repository.

# **Project name:** # Classifications (w/ Python & R)

## Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method selection is the process of finalizing your model based on various potential modeling options. Here in these repository, we are  learning about two model selection techniques namely "K-Fold" and "Grid Search" that can help you determiong the right model with optimum parameters for better and acurate predictions on any Classification and Regressions models. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this repository, we are implementing some commonly used model selection technique to enhance the performance of model by determining right type of model and by using right parameters for best results.


## Installation 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be able to apply these regression techniques to predict outcome on your dataset you need to have following tools and libraries:
  * Python 2.x or Python 3.x
  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * Scikit-Learn
  * R (For R implementation)

## Usage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Model Selection is one of the very important technique to implement for the enhancement of your model. You can use these model selection methods to make your existing model even more sophisticated.
